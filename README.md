## Additional material

### fastai material
* [fast.ai course v4 repo](https://github.com/fastai/course-v4) (here you find the course notebooks)
* [fastai v2 library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2) (start here to install the new fastai library)
* [fastai v2 documentation](https://dev.fast.ai) (look here if you need help on the library, e.g., examples, functions, etc.)
* [fast.ai book repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) (for information on the library and the theory behind it)
* [fastai publication](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/) (to get an overview of the fastai library design and the ideas behind it)

### Forum
* [Study Group in Austria (open thread)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/study-group-in-austria/26119/10)

### Setup
* [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) (Has already a fastai2 setup which seems to be the easiest version.)
* [Colab guide](https://github.com/seduerr91/fastAI_v4/blob/master/fastai2%20on%20colab.md) ([Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup))

# fast.ai v4 part 1 and PyTorch v1 Course in Vienna v3
*To be filled with information soon. Feel free to add material with pull requests.*

## fastai material
* [fast.ai course v4 repo](https://github.com/fastai/course-v4) (here you find the course notebooks)
* [fastai v2 library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2) (start here to install the new fastai library)
* [fastai v2 documentation](https://dev.fast.ai) (look here if you need help on the library, e.g., examples, functions, etc.)
* [fast.ai book repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) (for information on the library and the theory behind it)
* [fastai publication](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/) (to get an overview of the fastai library design and the ideas behind it)

## Forum
* [Study Group in Austria (open thread)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/study-group-in-austria/26119/10)

## Setup
* [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) (Has already a fastai2 setup which seems to be the easiest version.)
* [Colab guide](https://github.com/seduerr91/fastAI_v4/blob/master/fastai2%20on%20colab.md)

* [fastai2 medical imaging module](https://dev.fast.ai/medical.imaging) & [older notebooks from Jeremy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/discussion/114214) (However, these notebooks will not work out of the box, but maybe we can port them to fastai2?)
